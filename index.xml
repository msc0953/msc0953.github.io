      <description>Tools  Azure DevOps  Installing Required Azure DevOps Extensions   Terrform CLI Docker  Environment We are going build three components within End-to-End testing environment:
 Pipelines - build robot-framework docker image, execute e2e test cases Infrastructure - All services in end-to-end testing environment, include pipeline, repo, variables, agnet pool  Test Runner - The machine installed robot framework to execute test cases as container    Pipelines  build robot-framework docker image execute end-to-end test case  Test Runner  Multiple test runner run as container within Azure Container Instances Group  Azure Container Registry Docker registry service connections  add new service connections by manully (workarround)   Tasks used in your pipeline to build images, push images The template used to create your test runner: docker-robot-framework The template used to provision your test runner in Azure container Group: terraform-azurerm-aci-devops-agent   Execute sample test cases in pipeline to choose one test runner from Azure agent pool  Troubleshoot  Build your docker iamge on local machine  docker build -t=&amp;#34;latest&amp;#34; .</description>
